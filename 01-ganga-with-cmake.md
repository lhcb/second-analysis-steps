Before starting, you should read the [first Ganga lesson][first-ganga], which 
gives some advice about choosing a Ganga version, making a clean environment 
for running Ganga in, and where to go to get help when things in Ganga go 
wrong.

The `lb-dev` command allows you to start hacking on LHCb code very quickly. The 
downside is that Ganga does not yet support the use of local projects created 
with `lb-dev` when you run an application.

In this lesson, we will go through a workaround that will allow you to use 
local projects with Ganga jobs, wherever they run.

We will create a local version of DaVinci with some modified algorithm, so that 
we can check that Ganga is using the local version when we submit a job.
First, we'll create a local DaVinci with `lb-dev`, and will then fetch the 
[`DecayTreeTuple`][dtt-package], which lives under the `Phys` hat.

```shell
$ lb-dev DaVinci v40r1p3
$ cd DaVinciDev_v40r1p3
$ getpack Phys/DecayTreeTuple v5r6
```

We will do something silly as a test: add a `_2M` branch to 
`TupleToolKinematic` that fills twice the invariant mass of the particle. To do 
this, we just need to edit the implementation file at 
`src/TupleToolKinematic.cpp`.
Line 76 of that file reads like this:

```cpp
test &= tuple->column( prefix+"_M", P->momentum().M() );
```

Here, `tuple` is a object representing the ntuple to be filled, and the 
`column` method tells the ntuple to fill the branch named by the first argument 
(a `string`) with the value of the second argument.
Create a line just below this one, using `_2M` as the branch name suffix as 
twice the particle mass as the value.

```cpp
test &= tuple->column( prefix+"_2M", 2*P->momentum().M() );
```

Then we just need to compile our local DaVinci package. You must be in the 
`DaVinci_v40r1p3` when executing the following commands:

```shell
# Using -j8 runs up to 8 tasks in parallel, speeding up the build
$ make -j8
$ make install
```

This will create a folder called `a`. It is this folder that Ganga needs to 
know about to use the local project. We will create a [symbolic link][symlink] 
to this folder in the place that Ganga looks.

```shell
$ mkdir -p ~/cmtuser/DaVinci_v40r1p3
$ cd ~/cmtuser/DaVinci_v40r1p3
$ ln -s ~/DaVinciDev_v40r1p3/InstallArea
$ ls -la
drwxr-xr-x.  2 username z5 2048 May 19 09:05 .
drwxr-xr-x.  2 username z5 2048 May 19 09:05 ..
lrwxr-xr-x.  1 username z5   58 May 19 09:05 InstallArea -> /afs/cern.ch/user/a/apearce/DaVinciDev_v40r1p3/InstallArea
```

You can see the link in the output of `ls -la`: the arrow `->` says that 
`InstallArea` is a link to our `InstallArea` created by `lb-dev`.

Now we can proceed as usual, defining a job running DaVinci in Ganga.

```shell
$ lb-run Ganga v601r19 ganga
```

```
j = Job(name='Local_DaVinci_Test')
j.application = DaVinci(version='v40r1p3')
j.applications.optsfile = [...]
j.inputdata = [...]
j.outputfiles = [LocalFile('*.root')]
j.submit()
```

Confirm that you have a `_2M` branch in your output ROOT file.
